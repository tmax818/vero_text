Lists
=====

Python lists are an indexed, mutable sequence of comma-separated items.

.. code-block:: python

    my_list = [True, 42, 3.14, 75]

Python lists can contain a mix of different data types. The list above contains a Boolean, two integers and a float. Run the following code in the Veroskills interface:

.. code-block:: python

    help(list)

Scroll down and find the list methods that don't have a double underscore on the beginning and end of the method name. Practice with as many of these methods as you can.
