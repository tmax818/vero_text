The Python Standard Library

The `Python Standard Library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/>`_ is what makes Python a **batteries included** language. The Standard Library has code for handling just about anything you can imagine. The following code will open the webpage for the Standard Library using a module, :code:`webbrowser` from the Standard Library!

.. code-block:: python

    import webbrowser
    webbrowser.open("https://docs.python.org/3/library/")

The following code will print a calendar for the year 2021:
