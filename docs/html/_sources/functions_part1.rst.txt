Functions (Part 1)
===================

Functions are the heart of programming. The following is the simplest function you can write in Python.

.. code-block:: python

    def function_name():
        """This function is useless!"""
        pass

We use the :code:`def` keyword to define our function. We give it a name the same way we name our variables. As you probably figured out by now, anything indented under the function definition is the `body` of the function.

.. danger:: Naming Things

    It is important to give items in our programs meaningful and helpful names. This is notoriously difficult to do. You would never give a function a name like 'function_name' or 'my_func'. A function's name should indicate what that function does.
