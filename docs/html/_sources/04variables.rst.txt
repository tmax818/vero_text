Variables
=========

A variable is a named location in the memory (i.e. RAM) of your computer. The following code will create a space in memory to store the **string**,"Spam."

.. code-block:: python

    message = "Spam"

It's important to remember a few rules when defining variables in python:

- they are case-sensitive
- variables must begin with a letter or underscore(_)
- they cannot be a Python `keyword <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords>`_.


Variables, or the ability for a computer to "remember" things, allows us to take a huge leap in the power of the programs we can write. They are part of what makes Python a programming language and not just a fancy calcluator.
