Introduction
============

Welcome to *Introduction to Python*, with `Veroskills <https://veroskills.com>`_. This course will serve as an introduction to coding via the `Python <https://python.org>`_ programming language.

.. admonition:: Python reads like English

   Python is the ideal first programming language. We write Python code in a manner that is analogous to written English.

History of Python
++++++++++++++++++ 

Python was written in 1991 by `Guido van Rossem <https://gvanrossum.github.io/>`_. He named the language after the British comedy troop `Monty Python <http://montypython.com/>`_.

.. sidebar:: Interesting Note:

    Take a moment to visit the Python creator's website. It seems to be an axiom that the biggest programming superstars all have the most lackluster websites. Follow his links and read a bit. This will help immerse you in the Python culture. This is one, you know?

It's tradition that the first program you write simply prints, "Hello, World" to the screen. The following is how you would write that program in the C programming language.

.. code-block:: c

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        puts("Hello, World");
        return 0;
    }

This is the same program written in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    print("Hello, World")

This is not meant to be a criticism of the C language. On the contrary, learning C is highly recommended. However, you should master a language like Python first.

Exercise
++++++++

.. admonition:: Practice these in the Veroskills interface

   - Write a Python program that prints another string to the screen.
   - Read the documentation for the Python :code:`print()` function. Try to print multiple strings and change the output.
