Dictionaries
============

A Python dictionary is a set of key/value pairs. Python dictionaries have the requirement that the keys are unique and immutable. In other languages, dictionaries are called by various names; they are hashes in Ruby, or associative arrays in many other languages. I think that Python's term for this data structure is perfect. It provides the ideal mental image of what it is and its purpose.

Python dictionaries have to have immutable keys. The reason for this is a more advanced topic, so just use strings for your dictionary keys when you are beginning.
