Sequences
=========

A sequence is an enumerated(i.e. numbered) collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and the order of the objects matters. There are three main types of sequences in Python: 

- lists:

.. code-block:: python

    my_list = [1, 2, True, 'string']


- tuples

.. code-block:: python

    my_tuple = ("John", 37, True)


- ranges

    A range is a generator of a sequence of ordered integers.

There is a fourth type of sequence in Python called a string. We will use strings throughout the course, but will will reserve an in depth discussion until later in the course.

.. code-block:: python
    my_list = [1, 42, 31]
    len(my_list)
    min(my_list)
    max(my_list)
