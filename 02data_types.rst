Data Types

.. admonition:: Four Data Types

    There are four main data types in Python. They are listed in the tables below. Some texts will include the `String` data type as a basic or primitive type. The Python string is a sequence and will be covered later in this course.

.. list-table:: Python Data Types
   :widths: 15, 15, 15
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Types
     - Examples
   * - integer
     - :code:`int`
     - 42
   * - float
     - :code:`float`
     - 3.14
   * - boolean
     - :code:`bool`
     - :code:`True` or :code:`False`
   * - None
     - :code:`None`
     - :code:`None`

We make the distinction between different data types to accommodate how a computer stores data. Computers only speak the language of *binary*. Computer memory can be understood as a very large array of 0s and 1s(aka binary, because there are only two values). Python will automatically understand the data type of the item you are storing. However, having a basic understanding of how data is stored, will allow us to write better programs in the future.
