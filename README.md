Welcome to Introduction to Python, with
[Veroskills](https://veroskills.com). This course will serve as an
introduction to coding via the [Python](https://python.org) programming
language.

::: {.admonition}
Python reads like English

Python is the ideal first programming language. We write Python code in
a manner that is analogous to written English.

History of Python ++++++

Python was written in 1991 by [Guido van
Rossem](https://gvanrossum.github.io/). He named the language after the
British comedy troop [Monty Python](http://montypython.com/).

**Interesting Note:**

Take a moment to visit the Python creator\'s website. It seems to be an
axiom that the biggest programming superstars all have the most
lackluster websites. Follow his links and read a bit. This will help
immerse you in the Python culture. This is one, you know?

It\'s tradition that the first program you write simply prints, \"Hello,
World\" to the screen. The following is how you would write that program
in the C programming language.

``` {.c}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    puts("Hello, World");
    return 0;
}
```

This is the same program written in Python:

``` {.python}
print("Hello, World")
```

# Exercise

::: {.admonition}
Practice these in the Veroskills interface

-   Write a Python program that prints another string to the screen.
